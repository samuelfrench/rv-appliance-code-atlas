Scope:
- Dometic
- Norcold
- Suburban/Atwood
- Coleman-Mach
- Furrion
- Lippert
- Onan/Cummins

Rules:
- Official manufacturer support pages/manuals first.
- No unsourced fault-code entries.
- No DIY gas, electrical, generator, refrigerant, control-board, or safety-device repair instructions.
- Monetization placeholders are disabled until traffic data supports them.

Commands:

```bash
npm run validate:corpus
npm run test
npm run build
npm run traffic:report
npm run verify:runtime
```

Traffic monitor:

```bash
npm run traffic:monitor
```

Current corpus:
- `819` verified entries
- `105` symptom guides
- `301` official sources
- `925` generated indexable pages

Next automated batch goal:
- Triage official Suburban/Airxcel furnace and water-heater symptom-only support or owner-manual pages for ignition, airflow, overheating, low-voltage, water-temperature, freeze, and service-only boundaries; add only non-duplicate owner-safe guides.
