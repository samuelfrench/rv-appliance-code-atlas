## Current State — 2026-06-02
- Live URL: `https://rv-appliance-code-atlas.fly.dev/`
- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/samuelfrench/rv-appliance-code-atlas`
- Fly app: `rv-appliance-code-atlas`, one `shared-cpu-1x` 256 MB machine in `dfw`, auto-stop enabled.
- Latest deploy: Fly release v11, image `deployment-01KT3ND2CYNMCXD3V463VMRBKS`, code commit `9cb0585`; Deploy run `26806488234` succeeded.
- Corpus: `463` verified entries, `40` symptom guides, `81` official sources, `504` generated indexable pages.
- Local verification passed: RED/GREEN corpus regression for the OD-5001/Furrion tankless source batch, `npm run validate:corpus`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run source:audit`, `npm run traffic:report`, `npm run verify:runtime`, `git diff --check`, staged `git diff --cached --check`, and fresh HTTP `200` checks for all 14 new official source URLs. Build splits corpus to `dist/assets/corpus-vNV0ko7P.json` at `711.16 kB` / `48.37 kB` gzip and main JS to `209.75 kB` / `65.70 kB` gzip with no Vite chunk warning.
- Reviews passed: source/safety/spec and code-quality reviewers approved after removing Lippert QR-216 from Dometic/Suburban symptom guides; regression now asserts QR-216 maps only to `furrion-tankless-low-flow-temperature`.
- Live verification passed: `/`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/corpus-stats.json`, the seven new OD-5001/Furrion maintenance symptom routes, `/symptoms/furrion-tankless-water-heater-low-flow-temperature/`, `/symptoms/dometic-xt-water-heater-low-flow-cold-flow/`, and `/symptoms/suburban-tankless-water-heater-lockout/`; desktop and mobile Playwright found expected hydrated H1/source/safety content, verified QR-216 appears only on the Furrion low-flow route, and found `0` console/page errors.
- Source triage note: Dometic OD-5001 support pages and Furrion/Lippert support videos support symptom guidance only; no new water-heater code entries were added. Rejected owner-unsafe or cross-model candidates include OD-5001 no-water-flow plumbing reversal, Furrion service diagnostics/replacement videos, TI-514 E5 service material, Girard-specific videos, and mirrors/spec sheets.
- Next automated batch goal: research official owner-safe Girard/Lippert tankless and remaining manufacturer-hosted water-heater maintenance or winterization sources, keep model families separate, and add no code entries unless an official fault/display table is verified.

- [x] Add official water-heater symptom guides from Dometic XT, Suburban, and Furrion sources; split the corpus asset so the main bundle stays below the Vite warning threshold.
- [x] Add remaining official OD-5001 low-flow and temperature-control symptom pages plus Furrion/Lippert tankless support-video source links; continue manufacturer-hosted table discovery without adding code entries unless an official fault/display table is verified.

## Launch Automation
- [ ] Add weekly traffic report artifact once GSC is configured.
- [ ] Add IndexNow key after domain/live URL is chosen.
- [ ] Add impression-based monetization readiness report after GSC data exists.
